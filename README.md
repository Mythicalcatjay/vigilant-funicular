Here's code for a Renp'y game I'm working on. The repository name is temporary and will be replaced with I think of a good one.
# Instructions for playtesters
If you want to use the code instead of simply just hoping in and reading it plainly, download the newest version of Renp'y
https://www.renpy.org/ Renp'y 8.1.1 "Where no one has gone before." 
From there, start a new game and feel free to title it whatever you like. 
Then, go into the script.rpy file and copy everything from the script into the file. 
After that, make a new rpy file called "definitions.rpy" and copy everything from that file into that.
Once you hit save, you can go back into renp'y and launch project.
Have fun! :3
