Here's code for a Renp'y game I'm working on. The repository name is temporary and will be replaced with I think of a good one.
# Instructions for playtesters
If you want to use the code instead of simply just hoping in and reading it plainly, download the newest version of Renp'y
https://www.renpy.org/ Renp'y 8.1 "Where no one has gone before." 
From there, import the game files and art assets somewhere in the Ren'py folder.
When you have everything situated, just open the launcher and it will should have the game in it. 
Just hit launch project to play the game.
Have fun! :3 
* Note the Skins file is completely different. Open that file and follow the directions.
